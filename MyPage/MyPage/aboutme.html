	<h3><a name = "scope"></a>Scope</h3>
		<p>
		Most tags have opening and closing tags. Everything in a web object is contained within the opening and closing tags. Everything outside the tags belongs to another object. Watch the video below to learn how to create a basic HTML frame with Notepad++.

	<h3><a name = "head & body"></a>Head and Body</h3>
		<p>
		The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user of the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website, browser information etc.Below we will create a header of our own for our new website.
		The body of the site includes all of the actual site content, including paragraphs, images, audio, animations, backgrounds, and so on.
		</p>
		
		
	<h3><a name = "comments & header"></a>Comments and Header</h3>
		<p>
		You can add comments to your website documents just like with Python, or Java, or any other programming language. 
		We can add links to a page by using the "anchor" tag. The anchor tag allows us to link to other sites, other pages on our own site, or even specific places in a particular page.
		The header is a system of section titles arranged from h1 to h6 in Descending order. h1 has the biggest font size, while h6 has the smallest. 
		Adding a Page Navigation with Links:
		You can add links to separate parts of pages by naming your different sections and creating links to them. 
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "tool tips & images"></a>Tool tips and Images</h3>
		<p>
		Tool tips allow the user to hover over elements of a page for further explanation of what they do. For example, we would probably want a tool tip added to the link to the Star Wars page, because the link text itself doesn't give much information about what the link does.....
		To adjust the size of an image, you only need to adjust the height attribute. If you are keeping the aspect ratio (proportions / shape) of the image the same. You can also distort the image by changing around the height and width.
